OBJECTIVE
The core objective of SafeSight is to build a smart, real-time, and scalable safety infrastructure by leveraging AI-based video surveillance and gesture recognition technology. The solution focuses on preventing and responding to safety threats for women before they escalate.
________________________________________
FUNCTIONALITY
SafeSight is built with two key components working in tandem:
üîπ 1. Intelligent Camera System
The AI-powered CCTV system monitors real-time footage to detect potential threats, such as distress gestures or suspicious activities. It instantly alerts authorities for quick intervention. This proactive approach enhances public safety and prevents incidents before they escalate.
üîπ 2. Gesture-Based Mobile App
1.	The safety app offers features like SafeSpot navigation and SOS alerts, which can be sent even in low-network areas. Along with these, the app includes several other safety features to enhance women's security and provide proactive.________________________________________
